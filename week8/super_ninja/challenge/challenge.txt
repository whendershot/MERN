Super Ninja
Objectives: 
Practice extending a class and making instances from it
Practice accessing the inherited methods and attributes of the instances.
Sensei Class
Extend the Ninja class and create the Sensei class. A Sensei should have 200 Health, 10 speed, and 10 strength by default.

In addition, a Sensei should have a new attribute called wisdom, and the default should be 10.

Finally, add the speakWisdom() method. speakWisdom() should call the drinkSake() method from the Ninja class, before console.logging a wise message.

// example output
const superSensei = new Sensei("Master Splinter");
superSensei.speakWisdom();
// -> "What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months."
superSensei.showStats();
// -> "Name: Master Splinter, Health: 210, Speed: 10, Strength: 10"copy
