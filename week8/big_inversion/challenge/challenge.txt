Big Inversion
Redo the Prop It Up assignment and turn the functional components into class components.

Create a component called PersonCard that accepts the following props: 

firstName
lastName
age
hairColor
Then, display four PersonCard components that show four different people, using props.

** This will not require a form for data input.  Use static information passed through component attributes (props).

NOTE:  You can use a component repeatedly and use different values each time.  Example:

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <SaleItem prop1={ value1 } />
            <SaleItem prop1={ value2 } />
            <SaleItem prop1={ value3 } />
        </div>
    );
}
copy






Create a new component called PersonCard to display a single person's set of information using props for values

Call the Person component repeatedly using different prop values to display 4 unique sets of information
