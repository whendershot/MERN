Box Generator
Create a component with a form inside which accepts a color. When the form is submitted, add a box to the set of boxes with the appropriate color. You may use whichever method of styling you prefer; refer back to the end of the previous module (Class Components -> Styles) for more information on styling. The boxes should appear next to one another and wrap around if needed.



Allow the user to create/add boxes of various colors.

On successfully adding a new box, have it appear in the set immediately.

Ninja Bonus: clear out the color input on successful submission.

Ninja Bonus: Add a second input that takes in an integer. This integer will allow the user to specify the height and width of the generated box.
