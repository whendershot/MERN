More Forms
Using the previous assignment "Hook Form", add error messages.

If the First Name or Last Name is less than 2 characters, output an error message saying that field must be at least 2 characters.
The e-mail is less than 5 characters, say the field must be at least 5 characters.
The passwords must match and be at least 8 characters.
These messages can appear right when you render the page, and will disappear in real time.

Hint: Use state and conditional rendering.




Create validations for First Name

Create validations for Last Name

Create validations for Email

Create validations for password and confirm password

Sensei Bonus: Only show the validations if the input is not blank (You should not see the error messages if you have not typed anything in)
