Putting it Together
Using the same assignment as the Prop It Up assignment, create a birthday button that will increase one person's age by one.






Create a state variable to hold the age of the person (passed in via the props object)

Create a button that increases the person's age by 1 year each time it is clicked

Display the current value of age from state (not the original value from the props object)
