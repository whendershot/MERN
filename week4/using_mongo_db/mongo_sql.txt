Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
use my_first_db


Create students collection.
db.createCollection("students")


Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
db.students.insert({name: "Bill", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 1, birthday: {month: 1, day: 1, year: 1901}}) //depreciated
db.students.insertOne({name: "Bob", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 3, birthday: {month: 9, day: 18, year: 1983}})
db.students.insertMany([
    {name: "Becky", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 8, birthday: {month: 9, day: 17, year: 2020}},
    {name: "Beth", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 11, birthday: {month: 10, day: 11, year: 2012}},
    {name: "Bliney", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 15, birthday: {month: 8, day: 9, year: 2010}}
    ])


Get all students.
db.students.find()


Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.find({home_state: "California"})
db.students.find({home_state: "Washington"})

Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gte: 3}})


Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})

Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 9, $gte: 1}})

Add a field named 'interests' to all student documents in the collection. The field should be an array and contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', MongoDB'. Add this field to all documents using a single command.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {interests: ["coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"]}})

Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
db.students.updateOne({name: "Bill"}, {$push: {interests: "Pizza"}})
db.students.updateOne({name: "Bob"}, {$push: {interests: "Tacos"}})
db.students.updateOne({name: "Becky"}, {$push: {interests: "Nachos"}})
db.students.updateOne({name: "Beth"}, {$push: {interests: "Karage"}})
db.students.updateOne({name: "Bliney"}, {$push: {interests: "Spaghetti"}})


Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
db.students.updateOne({name: "Bill"}, {$push: {interests: "taxes"}})


Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
db.students.updateOne({name: "Bill"}, {$pull: {interests: "taxes"}})


Remove all students who are from California.
db.students.drop({home_state: "California"})


Remove a student by name.
db.students.drop({name: "Bill"})


Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
db.students.deleteOne({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}})


Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})


Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.updateMany({home_state: "Washington"}, {$inc: {number_of_belts: 1}})


Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
db.students.updateMany({}, {$rename: {'number_of_belts': 'belts_earned'}})


Remove the 'lucky_number' field.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$unset: {lucky_number: ''}})


Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
