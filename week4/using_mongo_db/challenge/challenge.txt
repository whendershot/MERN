Using MongoDB


As you create the documents for this assignment, be sure to include students who have:

home_state of California or Washington
lucky_number ranging from 1 to 15
If you read through all tasks, you will understand these requirements better

To complete this assignment, copy your console text from the MongoDB shell in to a text document and upload it to the platform

Create a database called 'my_first_db'.

Create students collection.

Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})

Create 5 students with the appropriate info.

Get all students.

Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).

Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3

Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10

Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive)

Add a field named 'interests' to all student documents in the collection. The field should be an array and contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', MongoDB'. Add this field to all documents using a single command.

Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.

Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.

Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.

Remove all students who are from California.

Remove a student by name.

Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)

Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.

Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).

Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'

Remove the 'lucky_number' field.

Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
